This repository includes a parallel implementation of three distinct algorithm. The code is written in C and relies on the OpenMP and POSIX Threads (pthreads) libraries. The algorithms implemented efficiently compute the prefix/suffix minima (exercise A), matrix merge (exercise B) and pointer jumping (exercise C).

For more information please see the `Assignment X.pdf` and `Report Assignment X.pdf` PDFs included in each directory.

This project was done for TU Delft course: Parallel Algorithms and Parallel Computers (IN4026).
